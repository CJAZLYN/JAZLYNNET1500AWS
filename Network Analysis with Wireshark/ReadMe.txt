After installing Kali VBOX, we captured some traffic and analyzed it and saved it.

Wireshark is running on individual laptops, capturing network traffic, we will continues normal activities while Wireshark monitors traffic in the background.

Over the weekend 3/28 we are both going to do research how to analyze our packets we just found out about aircrack-ng that will help with that.
